# Pomodoro Web APP Project


### Goal: 

A Web App that allows users to input a time to set up a timer. The timer is based on the actual time(example: it is 3PM and you want to set a timer for 4PM. The user will enter (16, 0, 0). The user has to input the hour(in military time. Example.) 13 = 1PM). Next the user can choose the minutes of the time they want to set their timer to and same goes for the seconds. Next the user will click submit, and it will post the time on the list in the UI. Next the user can click on the play icon and it will fire the timer. If the user decides that they want to change the time on a timer that is already in the list, they can click on any of the text within the list and edit the text. Next, they will need to click on the pencil w/paper and it will update the database as well as refresh the page. If the user wants to remove the object from the database, they can simply click on the remove text next to the object and it will remove the object from the database as well as the UI.
